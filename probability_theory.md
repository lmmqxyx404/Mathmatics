# random test
1. before the test, we can predict all possible results.
2. before the test, we can not know the precise result.
3. The test could be repeated in the same condition.

## 1.1 sample spaces(always noted as S)
###  random event.
basic event
certain event
impossible event
The subset(not the element in S) of S is A.

### basic point
## Probability distribution
 - 1. Binomial distribution 
 - 2. Bernoulli distribution
 - 3. Unify
 - 4. Exponential
 - 5. Normal distribution

# Probability density function
The relation of variable and probability density function
in general,
  $$F(x) = \int_{-{\infty}}^{x}f(x){\mathrm{d}x} $$

# Expectation
## Random variables with finitely many outcomes


## Random variables with density
  $$E[X] = \int_{-{\infty}}^{+{\infty}}x*f(x){\mathrm{d}x} $$

# Law of the unconscious statistician
In probability theory and statistics, the law of the unconscious statistician, or LOTUS, is a theorem which expresses the expected value of a function g(X) of a random variable X in terms of g and the probability distribution of X.
