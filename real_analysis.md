# Chapter1 Function and Limitation
## function
 a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.

In short,domain and conversions forms a unique function.

# Chapter2 Two critical limits and Limit Existence Criteria

## Limit Existence Criteria
Monotone bounded series must converge.

## calculate the limit

### $a-b$ $(0-0)$
In mathematics, rationalizing is the process of converting a fraction expression into an equivalent expression in which the denominator does not contain irrational or other undesirable terms.
try to rationalizing the relative a-b. For example, you can multiply a+b.

### $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
get the ${\infty}$ factor and pay attention to the $+$ $-$ symbol.

### the case that have to consider the left limit and right limit
 - piecewise function
 - $\mathrm{e}^{\infty}$ because the symbol of ${\infty}$ could be + and -
 - $\arctan{x}$ and $x={\infty}$

### low-order infinitesimal plus a high-order infinitesimal
The result is a low-order infinitesimal

### first 2 then 1
like calculate a sphere. 
$\mathrm{d}v=\mathrm{d}s\mathrm{d}z$

$$\iiint\limits_{V} f(x, y, z) dV = \int_{z_1}^{z_2} f(z)dz\iint\limits_{D_z} ds$$

## curve integration
In mathematics, a line integral is an integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve.[1] The terms path integral, curve integral, and curvilinear integral are also used; contour integral is used as well, although that is typically reserved for line integrals in the complex plane.
### Green formula
transform $\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y$ to $\mathrm{d}s$

## surface integral
In mathematics, particularly multivariable calculus, a surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces. It can be thought of as the double integral analogue of the line integral. Given a surface, one may integrate a scalar field (that is, a function of position which returns a scalar as a value) over the surface, or a vector field (that is, a function which returns a vector as value). If a region R is not flat, then it is called a surface as shown in the illustration.

Surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the theories of classical electromagnetism.

### Gauss's law
#### condition
where the integral is taken over a closed surface S enclosing a volume V that contains a charge Q. This equation relates the electric field E at every point on the surface S to the charge Q enclosed within the surface.

Transfer $\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y\mathrm{d}z$ to $\mathrm{d}v$

### Stoke‘s Formula
Stokes' theorem establishes a connection between surface integrals and curve integrals.
In the application of Stokes' theorem, the direction of the surface should follow the right-hand rule.
There is a closing relation to Green's theorm
