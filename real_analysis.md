# Chapter1 Function and Limitation
## function
 a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.

In short,domain and conversions forms a unique function.

## curve integration
In mathematics, a line integral is an integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve.[1] The terms path integral, curve integral, and curvilinear integral are also used; contour integral is used as well, although that is typically reserved for line integrals in the complex plane.
### Green formula
transform dx dy to ds

## surface integral
In mathematics, particularly multivariable calculus, a surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces. It can be thought of as the double integral analogue of the line integral. Given a surface, one may integrate a scalar field (that is, a function of position which returns a scalar as a value) over the surface, or a vector field (that is, a function which returns a vector as value). If a region R is not flat, then it is called a surface as shown in the illustration.

Surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the theories of classical electromagnetism.
