## Contracts and Similarities

## quadratic form
In mathematics, a quadratic form is a polynomial with terms all of degree two ("form" is another name for a homogeneous polynomial). For example,
is a quadratic form in the variables x and y. The coefficients usually belong to a fixed field K, such as the real or complex numbers, and one speaks of a quadratic form over K. If {\displaystyle K=\mathbb {R} }{\displaystyle K=\mathbb {R} }, and the quadratic form takes zero only when all variables are simultaneously zero, then it is a definite quadratic form, otherwise it is an isotropic quadratic form.

Quadratic forms occupy a central place in various branches of mathematics, including number theory, linear algebra, group theory (orthogonal group), differential geometry (Riemannian metric, second fundamental form), differential topology (intersection forms of four-manifolds), and Lie theory (the Killing form).

Quadratic forms are not to be confused with a quadratic equation, which has only one variable and includes terms of degree two or less. A quadratic form is one case of the more general concept of homogeneous polynomials.

# Linear transformations
The basic properties of a linear transformation T: V → W are as follows:

1. Additivity: T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) for any vectors u, v in V.
2. Homogeneity: T(ku) = kT(u) for any scalar k and vector u in V.
3. The combination of 1 and 2.
